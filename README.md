6. after that, you will see a pop up window telling you to wait while the application loads.This is where my image is.
7. then you will see a tiny square and a big circle in the middle of the screen, you can control the square by using the direction keys, the gravity function is still a work in progress unfortunately, but right now if you approach the planet from some angles, it looks like it is kind of bouncing around parts of the planet.

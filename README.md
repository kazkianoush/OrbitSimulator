# Shuttle Simulator

## Introduction

questions:
- What will the application do?
-  Who will use it?
-  Why is this project of interest to you?

the application will be designed to run **shuttle simulations** as it traverses through the atmosphere and then later enters an orbit around the Earth. The users of this application will mainly be people who want to see how different variables effect the trajectory of a shuttle. This project is of interest to me because I really enjoy the integration of real life physics into a simulated world.

# Shuttle Simulator

## Introduction

questions:
- What will the application do?
-  Who will use it?
-  Why is this project of interest to you?

the application will be designed to run **shuttle simulations** as it traverses through the atmosphere and then later enters an orbit around the Earth. The users of this application will mainly be people who want to see how different variables effect the trajectory of a shuttle. This project is of interest to me because I really enjoy the integration of real life physics into a simulated world. 


## User Stories

- As a user, I want to be able to set up my Shuttle
- As a user, I want to be able to launch the simulation on my command
- As a user, I want to be able to see my Shuttle's movement in live time
- As a user, I want to be able to either choose a generic planet or make a planet of my own
- as a user, I want to be able to save the planets, and the shuttle that I have already made
- as a user, I want to be able to load up the planets, and the shuttle that I have created

## INSTRUCTIONS FOR GRADER
1. start application by running origin.
2. you will be prompted to either load your saved file, or to continue from scratch, this is up to you.
3. you will get a window asking you to choose a planet, and a shuttle. Here you either choose a default planet and shuttle, or choose to make a new one by clicking on "new" and then pressing submit, once you press submit, you will be taken to a page asking for inputs for either the shuttle or the planet you chose to make. after you have entered all the values, you can press submit again.
4. In this page, you can also delete a planet or shuttle by first clicking on the planet or shuttle, and then clicking on the corresponding delete button.
5. after you have selected and submitted a planet and a shuttle, you will be prompted with a pop up asking if you would like to save this file or not. This is up to you.
6. after that, you will see a pop up window telling you to wait while the application loads.This is where my image is.
7. then you will see a tiny square and a big circle in the middle of the screen, you can control the square by using the direction keys, the gravity function is still a work in progress unfortunately, but right now if you approach the planet from some angles, it looks like it is kind of bouncing around parts of the planet.

## PHASE 4: TASK 2

#### make sure to exit the application when you have completed the setup process and are in the game page.
- removed planet: Generic3 from planetList
- added a planet: newPlanet to the planetList
- removed shuttle: SaturnIII from shuttleList
- -added a shuttle: newShuttle to the shuttleList

## PHASE 4: TASK 3

# Shuttle Simulator

## Introduction

questions:
- What will the application do?
-  Who will use it?
-  Why is this project of interest to you?

the application will be designed to run **shuttle simulations** as it traverses through the atmosphere and then later enters an orbit around the Earth. The users of this application will mainly be people who want to see how different variables effect the trajectory of a shuttle. This project is of interest to me because I really enjoy the integration of real life physics into a simulated world. 


## User Stories

- As a user, I want to be able to set up my Shuttle
- As a user, I want to be able to launch the simulation on my command
- As a user, I want to be able to change the trajectory of my shuttle in live time
- As a user, I want to be able to either choose a planet or make a planet of my own
